  - **Cause**: Roles in format `"UserRole.ADMIN"` but code checked for `"admin"`
  - **Solution**: Intelligent enum parsing in `agent_tools.py` for all formats
  - **Result**: 100% functional user switching + family view display in interactive mode
  - **Testing**: Verified TestKid → zybex86 → Gwiazdka2016 switching in real-time
  - **ML Integration**: Confirmed per-user ML profiling during user switches
- [x] **🚨 CRITICAL PRICE ANALYSIS BUG FIXED**: Advanced Value Algorithm incorrectly recommended "WAIT FOR SALE" for ALL TIME LOW ✅
  - **Problem**: 80% discount (179.9→35.98 PLN) + ALL TIME LOW = "WAIT FOR SALE" instead of "INSTANT BUY"
  - **Cause**: Advanced algorithm ignored discount_factor and timing_factor in recommendation logic
  - **Solution**: Added intelligent discount/timing analysis in `utils/advanced_value_algorithms.py`
    * `discount_factor`: 0-3.0 based on % discount vs MSRP (70%+ = 3.0, 50%+ = 2.0, 30%+ = 1.0)
    * `timing_factor`: 0-2.5 based on all-time low status (≤5% ATL = 2.5, ≤15% = 1.5, ≤35% = 0.5)
    * `boosted_score = comprehensive_score + discount_factor + timing_factor`
  - **Result BEFORE**: "Immortals Fenyx Rising" → "WAIT FOR SALE" (5.35 score, INCORRECT)
  - **Result AFTER**: "Immortals Fenyx Rising" → "INSTANT BUY - Massive Discount!" (CORRECT)
  - **Impact**: Massive discount + all-time low detection for accurate recommendations
  - **Testing**: ✅ 80% discount recognition + ALL TIME LOW timing + proper recommendation generation

- 📚 Personal game collection tracking (owned/wishlist/not_interested)
- ⭐ User rating system with ML integration for enhanced personalization
- 🔗 DekuDeals collection import with automatic profile parsing
- 🎯 Collection-aware recommendations (exclude owned games)
- ⏱️ Estimated time: 6-8 hours

**OPTION B: Collaborative Filtering & Advanced Analytics (Phase 7.2)**
- 🤝 Collaborative filtering (user similarity matching)
- 📊 Advanced user behavior analytics with pattern clustering
- 🚨 Real-time price alerts with personalized thresholds
- 🎄 Seasonal price pattern analysis with holiday detection
- 👥 Cross-user recommendation engine with community insights
- ⏱️ Estimated time: 8-10 hours

**OPTION C: Public API Development (Phase 7.3)**
- 🔗 RESTful API with rate limiting and authentication
- 📚 API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- 🔌 Third-party integration capabilities
- 🛠️ SDK development for external developers
- ⏱️ Estimated time: 8-10 hours

**OPTION D: Web Interface Development (Phase 7.4)**
- 🌐 Modern React/Vue.js web application
- 📈 Real-time analysis dashboards with interactive charts
- 👥 User account management with social features
- 🎮 Community integration with shared recommendations
- ⏱️ Estimated time: 12-15 hours

**💡 RECOMMENDATION:** I suggest **NEW PRIORITY: PHASE 7.1.5 (User Collection Management)** - before collaborative filtering, it's worth adding personal collection management so the system can exclude owned games from recommendations and better personalize based on user's personal ratings.

**🔥 JUSTIFICATION FOR PHASE 7.1.5 PRIORITY:**
- ✅ **Immediate user value**: Excluding owned games from recommendations
- ✅ **Enhanced ML data**: Personal ratings as additional training data  
- ✅ **Multi-user support**: Family-friendly system
- ✅ **DekuDeals integration**: Automatic import without needing API
- ✅ **Foundation for 7.2**: Personal data will be crucial for collaborative filtering
- ✅ **Quick implementation**: 6-8 hours vs 8-10 for collaborative filtering
